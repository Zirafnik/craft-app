# CRAFT Method App

## For calculating layout costs in a job shop layout
USE: Choose the matrix sizes, and then enter the costs for transfer and distance in the matrix inputs. After that, enter the department you would like to fix.

This app was made after doing a long and tedious homework and exercises at my university's Operations Management class.
It is based on the exercises we have received and did in class, and therefore might not suit everyone.
It takes 2 matrixes as inputs, and outputs not only the results, but also the calculation equations. It also outputs the optimal solution.
It uses the minimal number of combinations.
